    // Create a class Vehicle with properties Id, Type, YearOfProduction, BatchNumber.
    // Create two classes Car and Bike that inherit from Vehicle. Car has property FuelTank (int) and Countries in which it is produced and Bike has property Color.
    // Class Vehicle has method PrintVehicle that prints Id, Type and YearOfProduction.
    // Class Car also has method PrintVehicle that prints the Type and the Countries in which it is produced.
    // Class Bike also has method PrintVehicle that Prints the YearOfProduction and the Color.
    // Create a static class that serves as a DB, that has list of Vehicles. In this list put objects of type Car, Bike and Vehicle.
    // In the main program call PrintVehicle for each object in the list in the db.
    // Create a static class called Validator, that contains a method Validate, that receives a Vehicle and validates is Id is not 0, that Type is not empty and YearOfProduction is not 0.
    // Call Validate from main Program with a couple of objects.
